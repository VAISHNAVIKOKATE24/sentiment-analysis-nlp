## üöÄ Features
- Preprocesses text data (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Converts text to numeric form using **Bag of Words**
- Trains a **Naive Bayes Classifier** for sentiment prediction
- Includes ready-to-use trained models (`.pkl` files)
- Works on new datasets for **batch predictions**
- Jupyter notebooks for training, prediction, and visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
